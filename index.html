["What is \“What The Help\”?",
    "What The Help is my new project and charity organization. What The Help's mission is to try to support people who are depressed. It will focus on using the Internet to help people."],


["What does it mean to \“help support others online dealing with depression\”?",
    "Lots of people with depression (and other problems) look to the Internet to vent and ask for help or support. My goal is to write many supportive comments and responses for those people."],

["OK, so you’re going to supportive comments for people with depression. Where? How?",
    "For the beginning of What The Help, <span class=\"underline-text\">I pledge to spend at least 15 minutes every day trying to help others online</span>. 15 minutes does not sound like a lot. But it adds up. And I like that the goal is realistic.<br/><br/>My favorite website right now to do this is the depression subreddit on Reddit. (www.reddit.com/r/depression). But there are other websites that I use a lot too. For example, BlahTherapy (www.blahtherapy.com)."],

["What will you do with this website? (www.whatthehelp.org)", "I will try to update and improve this website every once in a while. I can write about my experiences trying to help depressed people over the Internet. I may also add articles, links to articles, or other resources related to helping people with depression. For now, I will work with existing services and websites rather than building my own platform or forum."],

["How experienced are you at doing this?",
  "I’ve been using the Internet to try to help people for a few years. A few years ago I became very interested in BlahTherapy.com. BlahTherapy.com has a popular free service that allows people to try to help each other. The way it works is one person joins as a volunteer listener and the other person joins as “venter”. Then it matches you up with a chat room.<br/><br/> Recently, I’ve been active on the depression subreddit. For the past year or so already, I’ve spent 15 minutes every day trying to reply to posts on that subreddit. I’ll find a post that I think I can give a good reply for, submit my comment, then look for another one. I use a 15 minute timer to make sure I’m working for at least 15 minutes."],

["Why is support like this valuable?", "Lots of people have problems that they are posting about online, including mental health problems such as depression. For example, over one hundred people post to the Depression subreddit on Reddit every day. These posts don't always get responses or helpful responses. It feels like everyone knows someone who is depressed or suicidal. So helping people with depression can have a huge affect on the population."],

["What has your experience been like so far? How do you know you’re doing a good job?",
    "It has been great. The people I reply to are often grateful that I am giving them attention and a thoughtful, helpful reply. On Reddit, my responses are public. Some times someone else (that is not the person I am replying to) will leave their own comment thanking me for my comment.<br/><br/> It's a really great way to help people. Often times these people are desperate to get a good response or good advice. Or even just support for what they are going through. Some of them are lonely or don’t know who else to get help from."],

["So what’s on the agenda in the short term?",
    "In the short term, I will continue to spend at least 15 minutes every day trying to help people online. I will also spend some time every week working on this organization, its website, and related projects."],

["What are your plans for the long term?",
    "There are lots of ways to help other people. I can imagine this organization working on a lot of different projects. \"What The Help\" should be able to evolve over time. \"People with depression\" is just one category of people that write posts online and could benefit from some supportive feedback. I could imagine What The Help working on other issues in addition to depression. But depression"],

["Why are you doing this?", "Life is short. It's very easy to say \"Oh, I'll do really wonderful stuff later on in life.\" But the best time to start working on something you care about is now. I think this could become a really meaningful project to me. Something that I enjoy working on when I have free-time. I want to do more things that I'm super proud of. And this is one of them."],

["Isn’t this weird? Are you weird for doing this?", "I mean, yeah, it's kind of weird. Not everybody wakes up and is like, \"I want to work on a non-profit organization today.\" It takes some courage to be unusual, even when it's being kind. It will probably end up helping a lot of people, which gives me courage. And it will give me something to be proud of. So I think the good outweighs the weird."],

["Why aren’t you doing more? It doesn’t seem like you’re doing much.", "I don't want to promise more than I can deliver. I want to start with small goals so that I can realistically achieve my goals. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. A kind deed that is small is better than nothing. It's easy to get overwhelmed by goals that are too large. Also, I want to have time to do other things like work a full-time job."],

["Who are you doing this for? Who do you want to help?", "Anyone can suffer from depression. Depression can even affect  people who have relatively great lives otherwise. I want to help all different types of people. I don't want anyone to feel like they don't qualified for my support. I don't want to discriminate based on nationality, race, age, gender or orientation, wealth, etc."],

["Isn’t it scary talking about depression?",
    "Yes, talking about my own depression is scary and intimidating sometimes. So I don't talk about it a lot. But many people have either gone through depression themselves or know someone who has. People are generally supportive and respectful when they hear you are trying to help other people."],

["What are some of the things you’ve learned about helping others?"],

["What is a typical message like (that you leave in reply to a post on Reddit)?",
    "I respond to the individual post rather and try to taylor it specific to that person. I do have a favorite way to end my comments... Lately I’ve been ending a lot of my messages with the phrase \“Rooting for you! Hope this helps.\""],

["Is this a registered 501c3 non-profit organization? Can I donate to What The Help and then mention them when I file my taxes to get some of that money back?",
    "Not at this time. But I will look into it. Hopefully it will be soon. I will try to fill out the necessary paperwork."],

["What is your own experience with depression?"],

["Can I see your profile on Reddit? Can I read all your public comments?"],

["What are some of your best replies as comments you’ve given people?"],

["I’ve met you before and you didn’t help me at all. You might even have been rude or a jerk while trying to help me.", "I wasn't born knowing how to be good at supporting another person. I wasn't even a fast learner. I probably even still have room to improve. There have been times when I, while trying to be helpful to someone, probably just made them feel worse. But I can look back on those and learn from them. I will do the best I can to do a great job anytime I try to be supportive of someone. I've definitely gotten better at learning what to say and what not to say."],

["What challenges do depressed people face? What are some common themes that people write about?"],

["Why name it “What The Help”? Isn’t that offensive or vulgar?", "It's a pun. I love puns! It's funny. It's memorable. It's cool. The domain name was available. To me, saying \"What the help\" is like saying, \"I don't care if it takes courage to try to help people, I'm goign to try anyway."],

["Isn't it sad reading dozens of posts written by people who are depressed?", "No, not for me. It's actually really enjoyable because I feel like I'm helping people. It's energizing because you feel like you're making a positive difference."],

["Do you have a psychology degree or a license?", "No. That's something I'll look into. In the meantime, I will be try to be very respectful of my own limitations. I won't do or say anything that I'm qualified for. I'm not going to give out medical advice or anything unethical."],

["Besides depression, what else could be helped in similar ways? By talking to people online.", "I think a lot of people with a lot of different issues are going online and looking for individual feedback. In addition to helping people with depression, there are some other areas that I think it would be cool to help people with: dating, figuring out school or their careers, helping people get out of racism, etc."],

["What is the Depression subreddit? What are the rules of the Depression subreddit?", "Any one can create a text post on the Depression subreddit on Reddit. I try to reply to the ones that I think I can help the most. Unlike most subreddits on Reddit, only text posts are allowed in the subreddit. It doesn't allow people to submit links. If you have a resource you want to share, you can write a text post about how you used it and how it affected you."],

["What is BlahTherapy.com?", "On BlahTherapy, you're matched into a chatroom to type with another person. Anyone can go to the website and ask to participate as either a Venter or a Listener. How helpful it is for the venter depends on how good the listener is."],

["What if I want to start doing my own stuff to help people online? Or help you help others? Or work alongside you?", "Go for it. I can try to give you advice. Contact me."],

["I want to give money to What The Help, what should I do?", "Contact me."],

["I want to get involved directly with the What The Help organization and work on that, what should I do?", "Contact me."],

["How can I contact your regarding What The Help? Feedback, comments, advice, press, or questions.", "Contact me via email: EmailWhatTheHelp@gmail.com "],

["Do people ever commit suicide after posting online?", "Sadly, some depressed people do end up committing suicide. This includes some of the people posting online about depression. But I think that we can help prevent some of the suicides if we're more supportive online."],

["What is the Suicide Prevention Hotline phone number?", "If you're having thoughts related to suicide, please call a suicide prevention hotline. In the USA, there is a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline that is available 24/7. The phone number is 1-800-273-8255."]
