["What is \‚ÄúWhat The Help\‚Äù?",
    "What The Help is my new project and charity organization. What The Help's mission is to support people who are depressed. It focuses on using the Internet to help people. I spend time every day responding to people online."],

["What does it mean to \‚Äúhelp support others online dealing with depression\‚Äù?",
    "Lots of people with depression (and other problems) go online ask for help, get support, or just to vent. My goal is to write helpful and supportive responses for as many people as I can."],

["OK, so you‚Äôre going to supportive comments for people with depression. Where? How?",
    "<span class=\"underline-text\">I'm going to try to spend 15 minutes every day trying to help others online</span>. 15 minutes a day may not sound like a lot. But it adds up over time. I have been doing this every day for over one and a half years. <br/><br/>There are at least three websites right now that I go to connect with people. My favorite one is 7cups (<a href=\"https://www.7cups.com\">7cups.com</a>). Another one is BlahTherapy (<a href=\"http://www.blahtherapy.com\">www.BlahTherapy.com</a>). Another one is a subreddit on Reddit called Getting_Over_It (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it\">www.reddit.com/r/depression</a>)."],


["What is BlahTherapy.com?", "On <a href=\"http://www.blahtherapy.com\">www.BlahTherapy.com</a>, you're matched into a chatroom to type with another person. Anyone can go to the website and ask to participate as either a Venter or a Listener. A venter is matched with a listener and they are put in an instant message chat room where they can type to each other. This service is free but they also advertise a paid online therapy service.<br><br>How helpful it is for the venter depends on how good the listener is. I am a really attentive and helpful listener. But because any one can be a listener, not all of them are good. Some of them are unhelpful or disconnect too soon."],

["What is the Getting_Over_It subreddit?", "Anyone can create a post on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it\">www.reddit.com/r/getting_over_it</a>. The intention is that other people will respond with helpful comments. I reply to the posts that I think I can help the most. I prefer the Getting_Over_It subreddit rather than the /r/Depression subreddit. Getting_Over_It is aimed at giving support and helpful advice, whereas the Depression subreddit is more weary of advice."],

["What is 7cups.com?", "7cups.com is a website that matches volunteer listeners with people who want to talk about their problems. Unlike BlahTherapy, you have to complete a short training before you can be a volunteer listener. The volunteer listeners on 7cups are instructed to listen compassionately but to avoid giving direct advice."],

["What is your Reddit username?", "My Reddit username is BronzeBeagle. Because leaving comments on posts on Reddit are public, you can see my comments on Reddit here: <a href=\"https://reddit.com/u/bronzebeagle\">reddit.com/u/bronzebeagle</a>"],

["Why is support like this valuable?", "Lots of people are posting online about their problems, including mental health issues such as depression. For example, each day over one hundred people post to Reddit's Depression subreddit. These posts don't always get responses or helpful responses.<br/><br/>Helping people with depression can have a huge affect on their lives and also the lives of people around them. Even if you're not depressed or suicidal, you are likely to know someone who is."],

["What is it that you teach?", "What has helped me the most is taking better care of myself. The better I take care of myself, the better I feel. For example, when I'm worried about a situation, there are usually steps I can take to try to make the situation better. For example, if I'm worried that I won't be successful as a software engineer, I can study more about software engineering. If I have chores I feel better when I do them sooner rather than later. I feel better when I work on things that are important or urgent rather than less important or less urgent. I also try to go to bed early, cut down on computer games and YouTube videos, eat a healthy diet. This way I have more confidence. And the more things I do that require motivation, the more motivation I tend to have. I try to help people see ways in which they can better take care of themselves based on their own situation."],

["What has your experience been like so far? How do you know you‚Äôre doing a good job?",
    "My experience has been great. The people I reply to often are grateful that I am wrote a thoughtful, helpful reply. Occasionally, someone besides the original poster will see my comment. On Reddit, my responses are public. So another person sometimes thanks me for the comment.<br/><br/> I think it's a really wonderful way to help people. Some of them are lonely or don‚Äôt know who else to get help from. And they appreciate the response, care, advice, and support. I've had lots several people say I helped change how they see something."],

["People can reply to the comments you write on Reddit. What are some of the responses you've gotten?",
  "<em>"+
  "- \‚ÄúThanks so much, I don't get much support else where\‚Äù<br>" +
  "- \"Thank you for all of the help/time. You didn't need to write all of these essays for me, but they've all made me put a lot of thought into my future, which has given me hope for what's to come. For that, I can't thank you enough.\"<br>"+
  "- \"Thank for the suggestions and for the encouragement, it really is appreciated\"<br>"+
  "- \"You just motivated me to go take a shower and dress up üòä thanks so much for your advice\"<br>"+
  "- \"thank you. Never saw this point of view, surprisingly\"<br>"+
  "- \"Than you for the kind words. They do help, more than you know\"<br>"+
  "- \"Thank you so much for the advice. I‚Äôm getting up and out of bed right now!\"<br>" + 
  "- \"Thank you, your kind words made me smile.\"<br>"+
  "- \"Damn... That is exactly what i needed to hear, thank you so much!\"<br>" +
  "- \"Your words were really touching. Its a journey-getting better, but it's one I want to be on\"<br>"+
  "‚Äì \"[Your response] really motivated me to be productive. It makes me feel less alone and cared for, something I haven‚Äôt felt in a long while.\"<br>"+
  "- \"You just restored my faith in humanity\"<br>"+
  "</em>",
  "responses"
],

["How experienced are you at doing this?",
  "I‚Äôve been using the Internet to try to help people for a few years. Eventually I started consistently doing at least 15 minutes every day. I don't remember exactly when I started doing this every day but it has been over one and a half years. I use a 15 minute timer to make sure I‚Äôm working for at least 15 minutes (Did you know Google has a timer feature? Just search for \"15 minute timer\"!)."],

["Why are you doing this?", "I want to help people who are battling depression. Life is short. It's very easy to say \"Oh, I'll do really wonderful stuff later on in life.\" But the best time to start working on something you care about is now. I think this could become a really meaningful project to me. Something that I enjoy working on when I have free-time. I want to do more things that I'm super proud of. And this is one of them."],

["What is a typical message like (that you leave in reply to a post on Reddit)?",
    "I respond to the individual post rather and try to taylor it specific to that person. I try to focus on things the person can do to improve their situation. I try to be very respectul of what they are thinking and feeling. Lately I‚Äôve been ending a lot of my messages with \‚ÄúTake good care of yourself. Rooting for you! Hope this helps.\""],

["So what‚Äôs on the agenda for What The Help in the short term?",
    "In the short term, I will continue to spend at least 15 minutes every day trying to help people online. I will also spend some time every week working on this organization and its website."],

["What are your plans for the long term?",
    "\"What The Help\" should be able to evolve over time. It will start out small. But over time it will add features and projects and events. For now it is just me trying to help other people online. But other people should be able to get involved too.<br/><br/>Also, people with depression is just one category of people that write posts online and could benefit from some supportive feedback. I could imagine What The Help working on other issues in addition to depression."],

["What will you do with this website? (www.whatthehelp.org)", "I will update this website every once in a while. I may write about my experiences trying to help depressed people over the Internet. I may also add articles, links to articles, or other resources related to helping people with depression. For now, I will work with existing services and websites rather than building my own platform or forum. If you want to get in touch with me directly, you can contact me through email (see below)."],

["Isn‚Äôt this weird? Are you weird for doing this?", "I mean, yeah, it's kind of weird. Most people don't wake up and be like, \"I want to help people with depression today.\" It takes some courage to be unusual, even when it's being kind. It will probably end up helping a lot of people, which gives me courage. And it will give me something to be proud of. So I think the good outweighs the weird."],

["Why aren‚Äôt you doing more? It doesn‚Äôt seem like you‚Äôre doing much.", "I want to start with small goals so that I can realistically achieve my goals. I don't want to promise more than I can deliver. I don't want to bite off more than I can chew. A kind deed that is small is better than nothing. It's easy to get overwhelmed by goals that are too large. Also, I want to have time to do other things like work a full-time job."],

["Who are you doing this for? Who do you want to help?", "Anyone can suffer from depression. Depression can even affect  people who have relatively great lives otherwise. I want to help all different types of people. I don't want anyone to feel like they don't qualified for my support. I don't want to discriminate based on nationality, race, age, gender, orientation, wealth, etc."],

["Isn‚Äôt it scary talking about depression?",
    "Yes, talking about my own depression is scary and intimidating sometimes. So I don't talk about it a lot. But many people have either gone through depression themselves or know someone who has. People are generally supportive and respectful when they hear you are trying to help other people."],

["Isn't it sad reading dozens of posts written by people who are depressed?", "No, not for me. It's actually really enjoyable because I feel like I'm helping people. It's energizing to feel like I'm making a positive difference. In fact, spending time replying to people has become one of my favorite things to do!"],

["I‚Äôve met you before and you didn‚Äôt help me at all. You might even have been rude or a jerk while trying to help me.", "There have been times when I, while trying to be helpful to someone, probably just made them feel worse. But I can look back on those and learn from them. I wasn't born knowing how to be good at supporting another person. I wasn't even a fast learner. I probably even still have room to improve. I will do the best I can to do a great job anytime I try to be supportive of someone. I've definitely gotten better at learning what to say and what not to say. Everyone has different ways of thinking about things, so something that might really help one person might just sound frustrating to another person."],

["Why name it ‚ÄúWhat The Help‚Äù? Isn‚Äôt that offensive or vulgar?", "It's a pun. I LOVE puns! It's funny. It's memorable. It's cool. The domain name was available. To me, saying \"What the help\" is like saying, \"I don't care if it takes courage to try to help people, I'm going to try anyway."],

["Do you have a psychology degree or a license?", "No. That's something I'll look into. In the meantime, I will be try to be very respectful of my own limitations. I won't do or say anything that I'm qualified for. I'm not going to give out medical advice or anything unethical."],

["What is your own experience with depression?", "I used to be very depressed. I even used to have thoughts about suicide. Now I'm a lot better. I think the things that helped most were improving my habits over time."],

["What are some of your best replies as comments you‚Äôve given people?"],

["What are some of the things you‚Äôve learned about helping others?"],

["What challenges do depressed people face? What are some common themes that people write about?"],

["Is this a registered 501c3 non-profit organization? Can I donate to What The Help and then mention them when I file my taxes to get some of that money back?",
    "Not at this time. But I will look into it. Hopefully it will be soon. I will try to fill out the necessary paperwork."],

["Besides depression, what else could be helped in similar ways? [By talking to people online.]", "I think a lot of people with a lot of different issues are going online and looking for individual feedback. In addition to helping people with depression, there are some other areas that I think it would be cool to help people with: dating, figuring out school or their careers, helping people get out of racism, etc."],

["What if I want to start doing my own stuff to help people online? Or help you help others? Or work alongside you?", "Contact me if you want to work with me, help me, or work alongside me. If you want to try it on your own, go for it."],

["I want to give money to What The Help, what should I do?", "Contact me."],

["Can you give me advice or coaching to help improve my life?", "Contact me."],

["I want to get involved directly with the What The Help organization and work on that, what should I do?", "Contact me."],

["How can I contact your regarding What The Help? Feedback, comments, advice, press, or questions.", "Contact me via email: EmailWhatTheHelp@gmail.com "],

["Do people ever commit suicide after posting online?", "Sadly, some depressed people do end up committing suicide. This includes some of the people posting online about depression. But I think that we can help prevent some of the suicides if we're more supportive online."],

["What is the Suicide Prevention Hotline phone number?", "If you're having thoughts related to suicide, please call a suicide prevention hotline. In the USA, there is a National Suicide Prevention Lifeline that is available 24/7. The phone number is 1-800-273-8255."]
